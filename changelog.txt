Version History:
0.1     Dec 14, 2012    Initial version. Basic init() function, delay() and
                        delayMicroseconds(), basic GPIO functions, i.e.
                        pinMode(), digitalWrite(), digitalRead().

0.2     Dec 15, 2012    Power-saving interrupt based delay() function that
                        puts processor to sleep during a delay implemented.
                        The improved delay function allows delays up to almost
                        5 days length. Crude pulseIn() function implemented.

0.3     Dec 17, 2012    PWM output implemented with the analogWrite() function.
                        Servo signal PWM mode added, and servoWrite() function
                        created for interfacing. Much improved implementation
                        of pulseIn() created using a timer instead of empirical
                        timing.

0.4     Dec 18, 2012    Implemented analogRead() and analog pin configuration.
                        Added timer functions using WTIMER4 to track elapsed time.
                        Broke off pin multiplexing and other global constant arrays
                        into stellarino_pins.h for better organization. Delay
                        functions grouped with timer functions in stellarino_timer.h
                        Switched PDL commands to ROM versions to reduce binary size.

0.5     Dec 19, 2012    Implemented basic FOSS UART library to eliminate dependence
                        on incompatibly licensed UARTstdio library. Renamed timer
                        functions to millis() and micros() to better match Wiring.
                        Modified timer functions to count one unit of time per timer
                        tick instead of one per ten ticks. This increased the range
                        of the timers ten-fold. Timers are now started automatically
                        upon init() to better match Wiring, but the ability to reset
                        the timers has been maintained. Fixed delayMicroseconds().
                        Added example using the setup() and loop() structure of Wiring
                        sketches.

0.6     Dec 20, 2012    Increased clock speed to 80 MHz and adjusted timer setup
                        appropriately. Added UART functions for unsigned decimal and
                        hexadecimal input and output.

0.7     Dec 26, 2012    Added SPI (master) support. Increased stack size to 512 bytes
                        to permit more complex programs and the safe use of printf and
                        similarly complex functions. Add MCP4921 DAC demo using SPI.
                        Set up release compile configuration. Added code to prevent
                        bricking through accidentally reconfiguring the JTAG pins.

0.8     Jan 1, 2013     Fixed 0 duty cycle PWM. Added instructions to README for
                        building driverlib-cm4f. Added post-build step to create a
                        flashable .bin file. Added vector table to permit code to run
                        automatically after a reset.
                        
0.9     Apr 7, 2013     Fixed millis() timer. Further increased stack size to 1024
                        bytes as there is no shortage of RAM on this MCU. Added new
                        UART functions for using UART ports other than UART0.

1.0     Jun 14, 2013    Fixed multiple PWM outputs from one timer. Created new two
                        speed LED colour fade example as the new default sample
                        program. Reduced PWM frequency to 500 Hz. The PWM frequency
                        is customizable via a macro in stellarino.h. Added servo
                        support to all PWM-capable pins. Added enableUART function
                        to simplify the configuration of UARTs.

1.1     Jul 10, 2013    Fixed geti/getu/geth functions for UART1 and up. Added pin
                        lock code to unlock PD7 for use as UART2. Created new UART
                        functions for floating point input and output. Added map()
                        macro for linearly mapping a number from one range to another.
                        
1.2     Oct 20, 2013    Switched to LGPL licence. Added UART RX buffering. Fixed bug
                        in putf that could cause stack overflow and infinite loop.
                        Removed math.h dependency. Improved project structure and
                        code formatting. Clarified the return value for UARTpeek.

1.3     Nov 28, 2013    Added support for Tiva C Series Launchpad. Added support for
                        development on Linux and Mac using GCC for ARM. Fixed
                        critical UART receive buffering bug (thanks to astro75).
                        Added new pwmWrite write function for arbitrary PWM output.
                        Added experimental support for using stdio.h functions such
                        as printf and and sscanf. Tested only with GCC. Some functions
                        are presently broken, such as scanf. Switched to TivaWare
                        from StellarisWare. Old Stellaris Launchpads should still
                        work as they did before.
