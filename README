/*************************ABOUT STELLARINO*************************/
Stellarino is a simple Wiring-like but incompatible interface library
implemented in C for the TI Stellaris LM4F120H5QR used in the
Stellaris Launchpad, and similar MCUs. It is meant to facilitate the
rapid creation of basic microcontroller firmware without the need to
parse through thousands of pages in datasheets and other documentation.
It uses syntax similar to Wiring to ease the introduction of newcomers
familiar with the Arduino and similar boards to the Stellaris platform.

Stellarino implements functions for configuration, delays, using timers,
GPIO, analog input, PWM, controlling hobby-style servomotors, UART, and
more. It was created using the TI StellarisWare Peripheral Driver Library.
It thus requires StellarisWare and a suitable IDE, such as TI Code Composer
Studio in order to function. Since Stellarino implements all basic
functionality using the StellarisWare PDL with simple, easy to understand
code, it also makes a good introductory example for use of the PDL.


/**********************HOW TO BUILD STELLARINO**********************/
In order to build Stellarino, you must first build the StrellarisWare
Peripheral Driver Library for the Cortex M4F, contained within the CCS
project driverlib-cm4f, and have that project inside your CCS workspace.

If you have not already done that, first do as follows:
1. In CCS, go to Project->Import Existing CCS Eclipse Project
2. Beside "Select search-directory" click on "Browse"
3. Browse to the root of your StellarisWare installation directory, select
   the folder called "driverlib", and hit OK. Two projects should be
   discovered in the box below.
4. Tick the project "driverlib-cm4f" and make sure "Copy projects into
   workspace" is selected. Hit finish.
5. Open the driverlib-cm4f project and hit build. You should be building the
   debug configuration.

Once driverlib-cm4f has been built within one's CCS workspace, one may
proceed to import and build Stellarino.

/************************GENERAL FUNCTIONS************************/
void init(void);
    This function must be called at the beginning of main() in any program
    to configure the microcontroller to function with Stellarino.


/*********************INPUT AND OUTPUT FUNCTIONS********************/
NOTE: 	FOR ALL IO FUNCTIONS, PIN SHOULD BE SPECIFIED IN THE FORM PX#.
        For example, Port A Pin 0 would be PA0. Pin names in this form
        have been predefined as macros in the library.

void pinMode(unsigned char pin, unsigned char mode);
    Configures the given pin for the given mode.
    mode should be one of the following (self-explanatory) macros:
        INPUT
        OUTPUT
        INPUT_PULLUP
        INPUT_PULLDOWN
        INPUT_ANALOG
        OUTPUT_PWM      // 500 Hz PWM, customizable via stellarino.h
        OUTPUT_SERVO    // Standard servo pulses every 20 ms

int digitalRead(unsigned char pin);
    Reads a pin configured as a digital input and returns 1 or 0
    depending on whether the pin is HIGH or LOW.

int analogRead(unsigned char pin);
    Uses the ADC to read the analog voltage on a pin configured for
    analog input. Returns a value from 0 to 4095. Reading takes 13 to
    23 microseconds.

void digitalWrite(unsigned char pin, short val);
    Writes a value to a pin configured for digital output.
    Please note that writing HIGH to an input pin will not give it
    pullup resistance. For pullup and pulldown, use the appropriate
    setting in pinMode.
    val can either be the macros HIGH or LOW (or the numbers 1 or 0)

void analogWrite(unsigned char pin, short val);
    Sets the PWM duty cycle of a pin configured for PWM output.
    val is the duty cycle, from 0 to 255. 0 is always off, 255 is
    always on.

void servoWrite(unsigned char pin, short val);
    Sets the pulse length in microseconds for a pin configured for servo
    pulse output.
    val is the pulse length in microseconds. val must be between 600 and
        2400 microseconds.

unsigned long pulseIn(unsigned char pin, short val, unsigned long timeout);
    Waits for a pulse to begin on a GPIO input pin until timeout, and
    returns the length of the pulse in microseconds if a pulse is detected.
    This function supports pulses with lengths between 1 us and 7 minutes.
    val is the polarity of the pulse, HIGH or LOW (1 or 0)
    timeout is the time to wait for a pulse to begin, in microseconds


/*************************TIMING FUNCTIONS************************/
void delay(unsigned long nTime);
    Pause for nTime milliseconds. Supports pauses up to 5 days in length.

void delayMicroseconds(unsigned long nTime);
    Pause for nTime microseconds.

void resetMillis(void);
    Reset a timer that will measure elapsed time in milliseconds.

unsigned long millis(void);
    Returns the elapsed time in milliseconds since the millisecond timer was
    last reset. This timer can count for up to almost 25 days.

void resetMicros(void);
unsigned long micros(void);
    Similar to above, but time is measured in microseconds instead of
    milliseconds. This timer can only count for 71 minutes.


/**************************UART FUNCTIONS*************************/
Functions without the UART prefix use UART0, which is connected to the ICDI
on the Launchpad. UART-prefixed functions can use any UART interface, from
UART0 all the way to UART7. Just specify the appropriate UART number as an
unsigned char. For example, to write a character to UART3, use the command
UARTputc(3, mychar);

Data on the ICDI UART is transmitted at 115200 baud by default, with 8 data
bits and 1 stop bit. The baud rate can be changed through a call to the
enableUART function.

void enableUART(uint8_t UART, unsigned long baudRate);
    Enables the given UART, and configures it to run at the given baud rate.
    Any arbitrary baud rate may be used, however for reliable communication,
    baud rates of 1200000 or below are recommended.

void puts(const char * str);
void UARTputs(uint8_t UART, const char * str);
    Outputs the string str over UART. Please note that unlike the standard
    C implementation of puts, this DOES NOT automatically append a newline.

char * gets(char * str, int num);
char * UARTgets(uint8_t UART, char * str, int num);
    Reads a string over UART until a newline is detected or the requested
    number of characters have been read.
    str is a pointer to a character array (C-style string) to which the
        string is read.
    num is the maximum number of characters to read (including the string
        termination character '\0')

void putc(char c);
void UARTputc(uint8_t UART, char c);
    Outputs the character c over UART.

void putln(void);
void UARTputln(uint8_t UART);
    Outputs a CRLF newline over UART.

char getc(void);
char UARTgetc(uint8_t UART);
    Returns a character read over UART. Waits for a character if one is not
    yet available. The character is erased from the buffer once read.

char peek(void);
char UARTpeek(uint8_t UART);
    Returns the next character from the buffer without clearing it.
    Successive calls to peek() and peekBlocking, and the next call to getc()
    will return the same character. Returns a character with value -1 if
    the buffer is empty.

char peekBlocking(void);
char UARTpeekBlocking(uint8_t UART);
    Returns the next character from the buffer without clearing it.
    Successive calls to peek() and peekBlocking, and the next call to getc()
    will return the same character. Waits for a character if the buffer is
    empty.

void puti(long i);
void UARTputi(uint8_t UART, long i);
    Outputs the signed long integer i as a decimal.

long geti(void);
long UARTgeti(uint8_t UART);
    Gets a decimal signed long integer over UART and returns it.

void putu(unsigned long u, uint8_t digits);
void UARTputu(uint8_t UART, unsigned long u, uint8_t digits);
    Outputs the unsigned long integer u as a decimal. Adds leading zeroes
    or truncates as required to match given number of digits.
    digits is the number of digits desired.

unsigned long getu(uint8_t digits);
unsigned long UARTgetu(uint8_t UART, uint8_t digits);
    Gets a decimal unsigned long integer over UART and returns it. Reads up
    to a non numeric character or till the digit limit.
    digits is the maximum number of digits to read.

void puth(unsigned long h, uint8_t digits);
void UARTputh(uint8_t UART, unsigned long h, uint8_t digits);
    Outputs the unsigned long integer h as a hexadecimal. Adds leading
    zeroes or truncates as required to match given number of digits.
    digits is the number of digits desired.

unsigned long geth(uint8_t digits);
unsigned long UARTgeth(uint8_t UART, uint8_t digits);
    Gets a hexadecimal unsigned long integer over UART and returns it.
    Reads up to a non numeric character or till the digit limit.
    digits is the maximum number of digits to read.

void putf(float f, uint8_t decimal);
void UARTputf(uint8_t UART, float f, uint8_t decimal);
    Outputs the floating point number f to the given number of decimal
    places over UART.
    decimal is the number of decimal places to output.

float getf();
float UARTgetf(uint8_t UART);
    Gets a floating point number over UART and returns it. This function
    does not accept numbers in scientific notation.


/**************************SPI/SSI FUNCTIONS*************************/
void enableSPI(unsigned short SPINum, unsigned short wordLength, unsigned long dataRate);
    Enables the selected SPI, and configures it for a specified
    word length in bits at a data rate specified in Hz. The pins associated
    with the selected SPI will be configured for SPI.
    SPINum is the number of the SPI (0 to 3)
    wordLenth is the length of each word in bits
    dataRate is the transmission rate in Hz

void SPIWrite(unsigned short SPINum, unsigned long data);
    Writes the given data to the selected SPI.
    SPINum is the number of the SPI
    data is the word to be transmitted

unsigned long SPIRead(unsigned short SPINum);
    Reads a word from the selected SPI. Will wait for data if buffer empty.
    SPINum is the number of the SPI
